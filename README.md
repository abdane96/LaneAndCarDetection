# LaneAndCarDetection

# Motivation
The purpose of this code is to detect lane lines in a side at an intersection. In addition, this code detects cars passing by in that side of the intersection. This is used for a smart IoT traffic intersection to count cars in all four sides of an intersection, and depending on the car density in each side, the code alters the Green/Red/Yellow/LeftTurn signals accordingly
